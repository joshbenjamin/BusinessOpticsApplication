# BusinessOpticsApplication
An application for employment at Business Optics. Goal is to display data on a Flask web page.
Languages Used: Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML

To run this task, ensure that the sqlite3, requests and Flask libraries are installed.
If not, navigate to your terminal and enter 'pip install requests' and 'pip install flask'

Steps:
1. Open the main.py within your selected IDE or run it through the terminal.
2. Navigate to the url 'localhost:1234'
3. To view account balances, navigate to 'localhost:1234/account/James' where James can be James, Josh or Satoshi.
This will then display the balances for these respective accounts
4. For stage 3 and on, feel free to add data to the database using the textfield and submit button

(Note: I could not get the Stage 5 routing to work but the asynchronous AJAX request is there)
